## About The Project

The **Blog Preview Card** challenge is a great starting point for beginners looking to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills. This project focuses on creating a clean and minimalist preview card layout for a blog post. Key aspects include working with HTML structure, mastering the box model, and implementing responsive design principles.

Your users should be able to:

- View the blog preview card on various screen sizes with an optimal layout.
- Enjoy a visually appealing, minimalist design.

This project does not require JavaScript, making it a great exercise for mastering core front-end skills.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned
